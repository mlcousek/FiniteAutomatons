# Finite Automata Simulator

## Overview
This project is an interactive application for working with finite automata with a limited number of states. The application allows users to create and execute finite automata for given inputs, including a step-by-step execution mode. 

## Features
- **Support for Different Automata Types**: Users can switch between different types of automata (e.g., Deterministic Finite Automaton - DFA, Nondeterministic Finite Automaton - NFA).
- **Graphical Representation**: Automata are visually represented in the user interface.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: The program allows stepwise execution for better understanding and debugging.
- **Minimization of Finite Automata**: Functionality to minimize automata to their simplest equivalent form.
- **Multiple Input Methods**:
  - Directly defining the transition function.
  - Loading automata from a file.
  - Interactive mode, where users can manually design automata by clicking to add states and create transitions interactively.
- **Regular Expression to Automaton Conversion**: The program will attempt to construct a finite automaton that accepts a given set of regular expressions.

## Technologies Used
- **C#** with **ASP.NET MVC** framework
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for interactive automata representation
- **.NET Framework** for application logic
